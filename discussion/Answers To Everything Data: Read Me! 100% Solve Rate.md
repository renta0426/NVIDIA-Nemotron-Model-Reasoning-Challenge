Answers To Everything Data: Read Me! 100% Solve Rate
I reverse engineered 100% of the dataset. It's all solvable. Below I'm going to show exactly how.

Since my compute isn't good enough to actually run this (Kaggle GPU environment is still broken for me), I'm bowing out of the comp. My only goal was the midpoint prize given my time constraints, and that's clearly off the table, so I'm opening up the playbook for anyone who can run it.

I'll break this into sections by category type, with my own think tracings included. One full think tracing per category will be posted in the comments below. If you have questions, please ask, because I obviously can't document every edge case that deviates from the exact pattern but is still solvable under the same framework.

I've put 200+ hours into this. If anyone wants to show appreciation, a like helps others see it.

I asked for teammates about a week ago and nobody reached out, which is unfortunate, because the Kaggle midpoint prize is being awarded while the only viable path on Blackwell GPUs inside Kaggle is the "slow" Mamba workaround. That effectively turns this into pay-to-play for anyone with access to GPU clusters outside Kaggle.

Anyway. Here's the work. Goodluck to all those that can compete.

( It is best practice for you to not copy me exactly, but using your own methods and integrate this into your already existing training pipeline )

BINARY

8-bit string in, 8-bit string out. Each output bit is an independent boolean function of the input bits, so you solve 8 one-bit problems and concatenate. For each bit, scan in order: constants → identity → NOT → 2-input gates (AND, OR, XOR, XNOR, NAND, NOR, and the 4 with-negation variants) → 3-input (MAJ, CHO, PAR3, AO/OA/AX/OX/XA/XO) → 4-input (AOA, OAO, PAR4, XX, AXA). First match wins. Ignore the flavor text wrapper completely, it's adversarial noise.

The two things that actually matter: bit-serial gate computation (the model cannot do multi-bit AND/OR/XOR in parallel, accuracy craters to 9.3%, so you force it to spell out every op one bit at a time like 0&1=0 1&1=1 0&0=0), and target verification (multiple ops can match all 8 example columns by coincidence, so every candidate has to be checked against the actual test input, not just the visible examples). Skip either one and you'll hallucinate plausible garbage or pass the examples and still eat shit on the hidden answer.

The reward function is per-bit GRPO at every step, which turns this from a cliff into a gradient climb. You get partial credit at every layer of the trace: laying out the OUT columns correctly, picking the right op, spelling out the bit-serial gate computation, the VER target check, and the final answer bit, all scored independently per bit position. Get 5/8 bits right at the op-match stage? You score on those 5. Nail the VER on 7 of them? You score on those 7. There's no single pass/fail gate until the very end. On top of that, 8/8 correct triggers a superlinear "champagne" bonus (+5 flat) so perfection is worth meaningfully more than 7/8 plus one lucky bit, which pulls the model hard toward actually closing out the problem instead of settling for near-miss. Contamination markers (language from other templates leaking in) and thrash markers ("let me try," "hmm," "actually") get heavy negative weights, so the model learns to commit to the template and execute, not spiral.

ENGLISH CIPHERS

Encrypted phrase in, plaintext phrase out. The cipher is a bijective derangement on a-z (every letter maps to exactly one other letter, no letter maps to itself). Pipeline is fixed: LEN (word lengths from the target) → TABLE (extract mappings by walking the example pairs letter by letter) → VER (cross-validate the table against all examples + a held-out example) → DECRYPT (char-by-char on the target, back-referencing confirmed mappings) → CHECK (len, alpha, vocab membership, no gaps) → ANS. Words come from a fixed ~90-word vocabulary in predictable patterns (character-verb-object, character-verb-adjective-object, etc.) so the phrase structure is tight.

Two things matter here. Char-by-char decryption is the cipher version of the bit-serial fix. If you let the model decrypt whole words at once, the language prior hijacks it and it starts hallucinating plausible English instead of actually applying the table, so you force it to walk one cipher letter at a time and look up each mapping. VOCAB fill handles incomplete tables. With only 6-8 example phrases you will almost never cover all 26 letters, so the target will have gaps marked ?. When a decoded word has gaps, you match against the fixed vocabulary by length, find the word that fits the confirmed letters, and fill the remaining mappings back into the table for downstream words. This turns partial coverage into full decryption without guessing.

Reward is per-letter GRPO at every stage of the pipeline, same gradient-climb structure as binary. You score on per-letter table accuracy, table coverage (N/26), the VER cross-check, per-letter decrypt correctness, VOCAB fill validity, per-word answer, and the final CHECK pass (length match, alpha-only, in-vocabulary, no residual ?). Every layer is partial credit, so getting 4/5 words right or nailing decrypt but missing one VOCAB fill still scores. All-words-correct gets a champagne bonus so the model pulls toward closing out the whole phrase instead of settling for mostly-right. Contamination markers from other templates (B0:, MAP:, LOCK:, binary/roman/gravity language) and thrash markers eat heavy negatives, so the model commits to the template and executes.

GRAVITY

Given a few (t, d) pairs that follow d = 0.5gt^2, find distance for a new time value. The gravity constant g is randomized per problem so you can't memorize, you have to derive it from the examples. Pipeline is SOLVE (use EX1 to get the rate constant, apply to target) → VER (rate consistency check against EX2) → ANS (2 decimal places, enforced format). Answer must be exactly X.XX, wrong format = zero points.

Two things matter. Rate-first decomposition: instead of extracting g explicitly then computing 0.5gt_target^2 in five operations, you just compute RATE = d/t^2 directly from EX1 (which is 0.5g, already), square the target time, multiply. Two ops instead of five, smaller intermediates, same answer, fewer places for the model to eat shit on arithmetic. The second trick is rate consistency for verification instead of full recomputation. If you verify by recomputing the answer two different ways, both paths hit the same arithmetic weaknesses and produce confident wrong agreement (VER says YES on a wrong answer). Instead: derive the rate from EX1, derive the rate from EX2 independently, check |RATE - RATE2| < 0.05. If the rates agree, the formula assumption is correct. This catches the failure mode where both computations are wrong in the same direction.

Reward is the same per-step GRPO gradient climb: term, preamble structure, math accuracy at each intermediate (t^2, rate, target squared, result, rounded), VER honesty (tiered, lying scored harder than missing), format compliance on the X.XX output, final answer. Contamination is format-specific here, stray brackets/semicolons or binary/boolean language from other templates eat heavy negatives because this template is pure numeric prose. Thrash markers same as always. Every intermediate is partial credit, so a good rate derivation with a bad final multiplication still scores, but contamination and thrash eat the whole run.

ROMAN

Bidirectional. Int-to-Roman OR Roman-to-int, trained 50/50 so the model is bulletproofed both directions in case the hidden test set flips on you. Forward pipeline: DECOMPOSE (split target into all four place slots TH/HU/TE/ON, with zeros shown explicitly as SKIP) → CAT (incremental concatenation, one segment at a time) → VER (round-trip re-parse the assembled string) → ANS. Reverse pipeline: PARSE (walk symbol groups with running total, subtractive pairs CM/CD/XC/XL/IX/IV treated as atomic units) → VER (rebuild the Roman string from the integer answer, string-compare to input) → ANS. Preamble anchors hard on "Roman numeral" identity because this template cross-contaminates easily with binary/symbol/digit if the model drifts.

Two things matter. Incremental CAT kills transposition errors. If you let the model emit MMDCLX as one token blob, it will absolutely eat XL as LX or swap CM for MC because those pairs are token attractors. Forcing it to write MM + DC = MMDC, then MMDC + LX = MMDCLX makes every concat step auditable. Round-trip VER is the other half. V9 verified by summing the original decomposed values, which agrees with wrong answers because you're checking the shelf, not the pill bottle. CataFix re-parses the assembled output string back to integers and sums that, or in reverse mode rebuilds the Roman string from the integer answer and string-compares to the original input. If the model transposed a pair during CAT, the reparse total won't match the target and CHK fires NO. That's the catch.

Reward is the same per-step GRPO gradient climb with a tiered VER honesty score, honest YES scores best, lying YES (claimed match but the numbers don't agree) is the worst, honest NO (caught own error) scores partial, confused NO scores worse than honest NO. This punishes the "VER rubber-stamps wrong answer" failure mode harder than just getting VER wrong. Contamination markers here include stray brackets, xor, AND, other factory language, and the antigame scope is post-preamble only because the preamble itself is intentionally English prose (the anchor). Thrash markers and champagne bonus same as always.

UNIT CON

Structurally the same as gravity but linear. Given example pairs of (input, output) measurements, find the output for a new input. The underlying relationship is output = input * factor where the factor is randomized per problem. Pipeline: SOLVE (compute RATE = out1/in1 from EX1, then RESULT = target * RATE, round to 2dp) → VER (rate consistency check against EX2) → ANS (exactly X.XX format, enforced in preamble). Two operations total.

Same two fixes as gravity, same reasoning. Rate-first collapses the math to one division and one multiplication so there's less room for the model to hallucinate digits on intermediate values. Rate consistency VER (|RATE - RATE2| < 0.01, tighter tolerance than gravity's 0.05 because there's no squaring to amplify rounding noise) instead of full recomputation, because recomputing hits the same arithmetic weaknesses and rubber-stamps wrong answers. All intermediates use fmt4 (4 decimal places, trailing zeros stripped), final answer uses fmt2 (exactly 2 decimal places, 1.50 stays 1.50). The format rule is hard, wrong decimal places = zero.

Reward is per-step GRPO: term, preamble identity, math accuracy (RATE correct, RESULT correct, RND correct), tiered VER honesty (lying YES is the worst, honest NO is better than confused NO), format compliance, final answer. Contamination fires on brackets, semicolons, xor, AND, anything that smells like binary/symbol/digit template language leaking in. Missing \boxed{} is instant death at -12. Perfect trace scores +18. Same gradient climb, same thrash penalties, same philosophy: every intermediate step is partial credit so the model can learn from near-misses instead of getting a flat zero for one bad multiplication.

( The "Hard Ones" lol ) - These were solve by myself first on paper on my sofa. Noticing patterns and working them by hand, and then once i ran them through a battery of classical ML test. I figured out that the K clustering is SO EXACT, that these next to are easy to solve and should be 100%able, by everyone. Their the exact same problems, but look slightly different.

SYMBOL-DIGIT

Input is AB⊕CD (four digits split by a random operator character), output is a number. The problem is figuring out three things at once: how are the four digits paired into two-digit operands (is it BA,DC? AB,CD? reversed?), what operation do you apply (add, mul, sub, cat, mulsub1, muladd1, etc., 14 operations total), and what output format gets applied to the raw result (rev for reversed, raw, abs, dsum for digit sum, zpad2 for zero-padded, operator-prefixed variants, etc., 14 formats total). That's 4 × 14 × 14 = 784 possible combos. The pipeline: PARSE (identify operator char, extract EX1 digits) → SCAN (frequency-ordered brute force through 47 combos that cover 99% of the competition distribution) → LOCK (commit to the winning combo) → APPLY (run it on the target) → ANS. For example, input 03}43 = 47 resolves to AB_CD|add1|raw because L=3, R=43, 3+43+1=47, raw format, match.

The scan is brute force but frequency-weighted, so the most common combos (BA_DC|add|rev at 13%, BA_DC|mul|rev at 12%) get checked first. When a combo matches EX1, it immediately verifies against EX2 to catch coincidental matches. This is the same false-positive trap as binary: a wrong combo can produce the right output on one example by accident (especially add vs addm1 vs add1 which only differ by ±1). If VER on EX2 fails, the match is rejected and scanning continues. 10% of training traces use combos deliberately NOT in the 47-entry scan order, so the model learns to emit #STOP:SCAN_LIMIT and still lock the answer. This teaches it what "I scanned everything and nothing matched" looks like, instead of hallucinating a fake match.

Reward is per-step GRPO: scan quality (every scan line's arithmetic is verifiable), LOCK accuracy (did it lock the right combo), VER correctness, final answer, plus a HARDSTOP bonus for correctly emitting #STOP on unsolvable scans instead of forcing a wrong match. Contamination markers are template-specific (RATE:, DECOMPOSE, Roman numeral, gravity/unitconv language) rather than character bans, because the operator characters legitimately include brackets, braces, and symbols that other factories ban. Thrash markers and antigame same as always.

CIPHER-DIGIT

Symbol-digit with an encryption layer on top. Every character, including the digits themselves, has been replaced by a random symbol via a fresh bijective cipher per problem. So where symbol-digit shows you 03}43 = 47, cipher-digit shows you *#\< = ##:#and you have to figure out both the cipher AND the operation. Pipeline: DETECT (identify the operator symbol by position, it's always index 2 in the input) → CRACK (build the symbol-to-digit mapping from the examples, e.g.=9 #=1 <=6 :=3) → SCAN (same 47-entry frequency-ordered brute force as symbol-digit, but operating on the decoded digits) → LOCK → APPLY (decode target, run the operation) → ENCODE (re-encrypt the numeric answer back to cipher symbols, one digit at a time) → ANS (boxed in cipher symbols, not digits). Format set is reduced to just rev/raw/abs` because operator-prefixed formats make no sense when the operator itself is encrypted.

The hard part is that the answer has to come back in cipher. The model has to crack the cipher, do the symbol-digit scan on decoded digits, then reverse the cipher to encode the output. Any mistake in the mapping propagates through the entire pipeline. The factory enforces that every digit appearing in the target's output must be visible somewhere in the examples (input or output side), otherwise the model would have no way to learn the encoding for that digit. VER is full-pipeline: decode EX2's input, form operands, compute the operation, format, re-encrypt, then compare the re-encrypted output to EX2's actual cipher output. This catches errors at every stage, not just the scan match.

Reward has the most layers of any factory: per-symbol cipher accuracy (r_cipher, each mapping pair scored independently), decode CHK, scan quality, LOCK, tiered VER honesty, per-digit encoding accuracy (r_encode, each output digit scored), final answer, HARDSTOP bonus for correct #STOP on unsolvable scans, plus all the standard contamination/thrash/antigame penalties. Perfect trace scores +33 (highest of any factory). A wrong cipher mapping that cascades into a wrong answer still scores partial credit on scan quality, LOCK, and any correct encode digits. Contamination explicitly bans symbol-digit template as a marker because the model must identify as cipher-digit, not skip the CRACK step and try to pattern-match on encrypted symbols directly.

Cipher-digit and symbol-digit converge to the same underlying combo distribution. I confirmed this by running k-means clustering on the operation frequencies across both datasets and the centroids landed within 0.0004 of each other. The cipher layer is cosmetic. Once you crack the mapping, it IS bare symbol-digit, which is why the SCAN_ORDER is reused with only the format set trimmed (no op-prefixed formats, since the operator is encrypted). And the broader methodology across every factory in this post is sudoku solving: you verify the math is correct FIRST at each step, lock what you can prove, and if you hit a contradiction later, you backtrack to the last verified step and try the next branch. You don't guess forward hoping it works. Every VER step, every CHK, every false-positive rejection in the scan is the same principle: prove each constraint before committing, and if the proof fails downstream, walk it back. That's why the templates work. That's why they're 100% solvable.

CLOSER

You're welcome. One day I hope to solve a Kaggle comp on methodology alone and take first, instead of watching placement come down to who can afford the compute. The Open Contribution Awards for best data method, best RL method, and best fine-tuning method are all locked behind a top 10% final leaderboard placement, which means even if your methodology is the cleanest in the competition, you can't win recognition for it without the hardware to push a submission into the top of the board. That's unfortunate, and it's the part that stings most about bowing out, because the methodology IS the work.

I'm still open to anyone who'd like to take me on as part of their team. My solo run is finished here, but the playbook above is solid, and if it helps you place, Im happy to help.

e35e4c23ced7: c maps to itself; so it's a bijection without the derangement restriction. but i'd still be happy to join your team if you'd like to invite me. but i don't have tons of compute. we have slightly different ideas, i've been doing SFT only. anyway, up to you !

But yes, compute allows you to iterate on ideas faster. I've "solved" a lot of the puzzles as well, but there are minor errors (like the bijection one) that are easiest seen from iteration, and compute allows that -- especially if you just need to refine and already have the big picture solved. The contest is mostly about the "small details," I believe. My solver currently is at 94%, but translating it to the model efficiently is all about iteration that compute affords!
